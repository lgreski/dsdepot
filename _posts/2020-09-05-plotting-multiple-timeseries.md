## Plotting multiple time series in a single plot

Recently a person posed a question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63558161/multiple-time-series-plots-for-several-stocks-in-r-returns-an-error) about how to combine multiple time series into a single plot within the `ggplot2` package. The question referenced another [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7820789/r-ggplot2-plot-several-time-series-in-a-plot) for a similar type of question, but the person who posted the new question wasn't able to apply the other answer in a way that produced the desired chart.

As specified in the question, data for various stock symbols is loaded into R via the `quantmod::getSymbols()` function, where the adjusted closing stock prices are extracted and saved to a vector.

    library(quantmod)
    library(TSclust)
    library(ggplot2)
    # download financial data

    symbols = c('ASX', 'AZN', 'BP', 'AAPL')
    start = as.Date("2014-01-01")
    until = as.Date("2014-12-31")

    stocks = lapply(symbols, function(symbol) {
        adjust = getSymbols(symbol,src='yahoo', from = start, to = until, auto.assign = FALSE)[, 6]
       names(adjust) = symbol
        adjust
      })

At this point the `symbols` object is a list that contains four `xts` (extensible time series) objects.

Code to produce a `qplot()` based on the [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7820789/r-ggplot2-plot-several-time-series-in-a-plot) referenced in the question generated an error.

    qplot(symbols, value, data = as.data.frame(stocks), geom = "line", group = variable) +
     facet_grid(variable ~ ., scale = "free_y")

    > qplot(symbols, value, data = as.data.frame(stocks), geom = "line", group = variable) +
    +   facet_grid(variable ~ ., scale = "free_y")
    Error: At least one layer must contain all faceting variables: `variable`.
    * Plot is missing `variable`
    * Layer 1 is missing `variable`
    Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

The `qplot()` fails because there is no column called `variable` in the data that is passed to the plot function. Additionally, in order to produce the desired chart we need to extract the dates from the `xts` objects generated by `quantmod::getSymbols()` so we can use them as the x axis variable on the chart.  

## A solution with Base R

With a few adjustments, the code posted in the original question can be edited to produce the desired results.

* Convert the `xts` objects to objects of type `data.frame`
* Rename columns and save the stock ticker symbols as a distinct column, resulting in a wide format tidy data frame
* Extract the `rownames()` that represent the time periods into another column

The revised code produces a list of data frames, one per stock ticker.

    stocks = lapply(symbols, function(symbol) {
      aStock = as.data.frame(getSymbols(symbol,src='yahoo', from = start, to = until,
                                        auto.assign = FALSE))
      colnames(aStock) <- c("Open","High","Low","Close","Volume","Adjusted")
      aStock$Symbol <- symbol
      aStock$Date <- as.Date(rownames(aStock),"%Y-%m-%d")
      aStock
    })

We use `rbind()` to consolidate the list into a single data frame.

      stocksDf <- do.call(rbind,stocks)

We use a combination of `qplot()` and helper functions from the `ggeasy` package to customize how the dates are rendered as x axis labels.

    library(ggeasy)
    qplot(Date, Adjusted, data = stocksDf, geom = "line", group = Symbol) +
         facet_grid(Symbol ~ ., scale = "free_y") +
         scale_x_date(date_breaks = "14 days") +
         easy_rotate_x_labels(angle = 45, side = "right")

Having corrected the errors in the original code, the `qplot()` produces the desired output.

## An *xts-friendly* solution

One of the wonderful but sometimes frustrating aspects of R is that there is always more than one way to accomplish a given task, and plotting multiple time series on a single chart is no exception.

A day after I answered the question, [Joshua Ulrich](https://about.me/joshuaulrich), one of the authors of [the `xts` package](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts), posted an answer that solves the problem in a manner that uses the `xts` objects in a manner more consistent with their original design.

Key differences in the two solutions include:

1. Load the stock ticker data into an environment, and then use `merge()` with `lapply()` to combine only the adjusted closing stock prices from all objects in the environment into one `xts` object <br><br>
2. Remove `.Adjusted` from the column names via `gsub()`<br><br>
3. Convert the `xts` object to a long form tidy data frame via `ggplot2::fortify()`

The `fortify()` function converts a model object to a data frame, and the `melt = 'TRUE'` argument converts the data from wide format to long format.

    library(quantmod)
    library(ggplot2)

    symbols <- c("ASX", "AZN", "BP", "AAPL")
    start <- as.Date("2014-01-01")
    until <- as.Date("2014-12-31")

    # import data into an environment
    e <- new.env()
    getSymbols(symbols, src = "yahoo", from = start, to = until, env = e)

    # extract the adjusted close and merge into one xts object
    stocks <- do.call(merge, lapply(e, Ad))

    # Remove the ".Adjusted" suffix from each symbol column name
    colnames(stocks) <- gsub(".Adjusted", "", colnames(stocks), fixed = TRUE)

    # convert the xts object to a long data frame
    stocks_df <- fortify(stocks, melt = TRUE)

The data frame generated by `fortify()` contains three columns, `Index` representing a date, `Series` representing the stock ticker, and `Value`, representing the Adjusted closing price on a given date.

    > head(stocks_df)
           Index Series    Value
    1 2014-01-02    AZN 19.53932
    2 2014-01-03    AZN 19.63607
    3 2014-01-06    AZN 19.64608
    4 2014-01-07    AZN 19.51931
    5 2014-01-08    AZN 19.52265
    6 2014-01-09    AZN 19.80621

The last step in the process is to generate the facetted `qplot()`.

    # plot the data
    qplot(Index, Value, data = stocks_df, geom = "line", group = Series) +
      facet_grid(Series ~ ., scale = "free_y")

## Observations

I'm not a frequent user of `quantmod`. The fact that `getSymbols()` returns `xts` objects where the column dimension includes a ticker symbol along with the actual column name has led me to use `lapply()` to separate the ticker names from the columns and immediately convert the objects to data frames, an object type with which I am more familiar.

Joshua's solution helped me realize that by retaining the `xts` object type and using `merge()`, I can avoid converting row names to a date column and defer separation of the stock ticker symbol from the column name.

Second, R is constantly changing. As I reviewed Joshua's code, I discovered that `ggplot2::fortify()` is being deprecated. The current `tidyverse` function that replicates the behavior of `fortify()` is `broom::tidy()`, and it enables us to avoid the `gsub()` step because it automatically tidies the column names.

    stocks <- do.call(merge, lapply(e, Ad))
    head(stocks)

    > head(stocks)
               AZN.Adjusted BP.Adjusted AAPL.Adjusted ASX.Adjusted
    2014-01-02     19.53932    31.31375      17.65500     3.338105
    2014-01-03     19.63607    31.24196      17.26720     3.302056
    2014-01-06     19.64608    31.32681      17.36135     3.244379
    2014-01-07     19.51931    31.68575      17.23719     3.287637
    2014-01-08     19.52265    31.80323      17.34635     3.395782
    2014-01-09     19.80621    31.88154      17.12484     3.352525

    library(broom)
    a_tibble <- tidy.zoo(stocks)
    head(a_tibble)
    > head(a_tibble)
    # A tibble: 6 x 3
      index      series value
      <date>     <chr>  <dbl>
    1 2014-01-02 AZN     19.5
    2 2014-01-03 AZN     19.6
    3 2014-01-06 AZN     19.6
    4 2014-01-07 AZN     19.5
    5 2014-01-08 AZN     19.5
    6 2014-01-09 AZN     19.8

I'm grateful that Joshua took the time to post an answer to this question because I learned some things from him, and in the future I'll be less likely to immediately convert `xts` objects to data frames when I work with time series.
