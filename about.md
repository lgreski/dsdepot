Leonard Greski currently serves as Vice President, Technology at Travelport, the partner of choice for travel's game changers.

Len joined Travelport in December 2015 and currently leads Solution Engineering and Platform Architecture within Global Technology Services. His teams are responsible for the engineering delivery of Travelport’s supplier connections, middleware services, and the cloud-based platform for Travelport's next generation application programming interface products based on the [Open Travel Alliance 2.0 specification](https://opentravel.org). The products developed by Len's team process hundreds of millions of requests per day, with peak throughput as high as 30,000 requests per second.

Leonard was previously Director, eCommerce Transformation at Hewlett-Packard, where he led a global team that delivered a graphically rich, easy-to-use eCommerce experience for U.S. consumers in half the time of a typical eCommerce program. The new HP consumer online store generated 19.3% year over year sales growth its first Cyber Monday in production.

Len also led delivery of the digital experience for HP’s Make it Matter branding campaign that debuted during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The digital experiences generated more than 4 billion impressions on Facebook, 5 million video views on YouTube, and 800,000 fans on LinkedIn during the campaign's first four months. The campaign also inspired 1.3 million visits to the *Make It Matter* landing page on HP.com, three times the number of visits inspired by HP's last corporate campaign.

Prior to joining Hewlett-Packard, Leonard led a variety of eCommerce initiatives at W.W. Grainger. His leadership helped grainger.com achieve the \#15 ranking in the Internet Retailer 500 in 2011, and the \#76 ranking in the Mobile Retailer 400 within 12 months of launching mobile commerce. Len led key product initiatives and designed the e-commerce architecture that powered Grainger e-commerce growth from 7% to 71% of Grainger's total business.

Leonard started his career in market research at Information Resources Inc., developing statistical and artificial intelligence models to predict consumer behavior. At IRI, Len developed the statistical models supporting the BehaviorScan Fastrac new product introduction service, worked on a neural network that supported the InfoScan product, and developed a machine learning algorithm that uncovered a large CPG manufacturer's secret price test that was being conducted in several markets in the Western United States.
